Of course. The design has been updated to use the `python-garminconnect` library and now includes a dedicated documentation section with links to all key upstream libraries.

## **GarminSync Application Design (Python Version)**

### **Basic Info**

**App Name:** GarminSync
**What it does:** A CLI application that downloads `.fit` files for every activity in Garmin Connect.

-----

### **Core Features**

1.  List all activities (`garminsync list --all`)
2.  List activities that have not been downloaded (`garminsync list --missing`)
3.  List activities that have been downloaded (`garminsync list --downloaded`)
4.  Download all missing activities (`garminsync download --missing`)

-----

### **Tech Stack 🐍**

  * **Frontend:** CLI (**Python**)
  * **Backend:** **Python**
  * **Database:** SQLite (`garmin.db`)
  * **Hosting:** Docker container
  * **Key Libraries:**
      * **`python-garminconnect`**: The library for Garmin Connect API communication.
      * **`typer`**: A modern and easy-to-use CLI framework (built on `click`).
      * **`python-dotenv`**: For loading credentials from a `.env` file.
      * **`sqlalchemy`**: A robust ORM for database interaction and schema management (using Alembic for migrations). The built-in `sqlite3` module can be used for simpler needs.
      * **`tqdm`**: For creating user-friendly progress bars.

-----

### **Data Structure**

The core database schema remains the same. It can be defined using raw SQL with the `sqlite3` module or, more robustly, with an `SQLAlchemy` model.

**SQLAlchemy Model Example (`models.py`):**

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, Boolean
from sqlalchemy.orm import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

class Activity(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'activities'
    
    activity_id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    start_time = Column(String, nullable=False)
    filename = Column(String, unique=True, nullable=True)
    downloaded = Column(Boolean, default=False, nullable=False)
```

-----

### **User Flow**

1.  User launches the container with their credentials: `docker run -it --env-file .env -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data garminsync`
2.  The application presents a help menu generated by `Typer`.
3.  User runs a command, e.g., `garminsync download --missing`.
4.  The application executes the task, showing progress indicators for API calls and downloads.
5.  Upon completion, the application displays a summary of actions taken.

-----

### **File Structure**

A standard Python project structure is recommended.

```
/garminsync
├── garminsync/              # Main application package
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── cli.py             # Typer CLI commands and entrypoint
│   ├── config.py          # Configuration loading (dotenv)
│   ├── database.py        # SQLAlchemy models and sync logic
│   └── garmin.py          # Wrapper for the python-garminconnect client
├── data/                    # Directory for downloaded .fit files and DB
├── tests/                   # Unit and integration tests
├── .env                     # Stores GARMIN_EMAIL/GARMIN_PASSWORD
├── .gitignore
├── Dockerfile
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt         # Pinned Python dependencies
```

-----

### **Technical Implementation Notes**

  * **Architecture:** A Python application using **`Typer`** for the CLI. Logic is separated into modules for configuration, database interaction, and Garmin communication.
  * **Authentication:** Credentials from `GARMIN_EMAIL` and `GARMIN_PASSWORD` environment variables are loaded via **`python-dotenv`** and passed to **`python-garminconnect`**.
  * **File Naming:** Files will be named using Python's f-strings: `f"activity_{activity_id}_{timestamp}.fit"`.
  * **Rate Limiting:** A simple `time.sleep(2)` will be inserted between API requests to avoid overloading Garmin's servers.
  * **Database:** The schema will be managed by **`SQLAlchemy`**. Versioned migrations can be handled by **Alembic**, which integrates with SQLAlchemy.
  * **Database Sync:** Before any operation, a sync function will use **`python-garminconnect`** to fetch the latest activities and reconcile them with the local SQLite database.
  * **Package Management:** Dependencies and their versions will be pinned in `requirements.txt` for reproducible builds (`pip freeze > requirements.txt`).
  * **Session Management:** **`python-garminconnect`** handles authentication and session management.
  * **Docker Permissions:** Mounting a local `./data` directory into the container allows downloaded files and the database to persist. The `sudo` prefix is generally not required if the user is part of the `docker` group.

### **Development Phases (Proposed for Python)**

#### **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**

  * [x] `Dockerfile` creation for a Python environment.
    * Uses Python 3.10 slim base image
    * Sets PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE and PYTHONUNBUFFERED
    * Installs build dependencies
    * Copies requirements first for layer caching
    * Sets ENV_FILE for configuration
    * Entrypoint runs application via `python -m garminsync`
  * [x] Setup `python-dotenv` for environment variable handling.
    * Added `python-dotenv` to requirements.txt
    * Implemented environment loading in config.py:
      ```python
      from dotenv import load_dotenv
      load_dotenv()  # Load .env file
      ```
    * Updated Dockerfile to copy .env file during build
    * Added documentation for environment variable setup
  * [x] Initialize the **`Typer`** CLI framework in `cli.py`.
    * Created basic Typer app structure
    * Implemented skeleton commands for `list` and `download`
    * Added proper type hints and docstrings
    * Integrated with config.py for environment variable loading
  * [x] Implement the **`python-garminconnect`** client wrapper (`garmin.py`).
    * Created GarminClient class with authentication
    * Implemented get_activities() with rate limiting
    * Implemented download_activity_fit() method
    * Added error handling for missing credentials

#### **Phase 2: Activity Listing**

  * [x] Implement the `SQLAlchemy` schema and database connection.
    * Created database.py with Activity model
    * Implemented init_db() for database initialization
    * Added get_session() for session management
    * Implemented sync_database() to fetch activities from Garmin and update database
  * [x] Create the `list` commands (`--all`, `--missing`, `--downloaded`).
    * Implemented command logic in cli.py
    * Added database synchronization before listing
    * Added input validation for filter options
    * Used tqdm for progress display

#### **Phase 3: Download Pipeline**

  * [x] Implement the `.fit` file download function using `python-garminconnect`.
    * Added download logic to cli.py
    * Used GarminClient to download FIT files
    * Created filename-safe timestamps
    * Saved files to data directory
  * [x] Ensure downloads are idempotent (don't re-download existing files).
    * Database tracks downloaded status
    * Only missing activities are downloaded
  * [x] Update the database record to `downloaded=True` on success.
    * Updated activity record after successful download
    * Set filename path in database

#### **Phase 4: Polish ✨**

  * [x] Add **`tqdm`** progress bars for the download command.
    * Implemented in both list and download commands
  * [x] Update Dockerfile to:
    * Use multi-stage builds for smaller image size
    * Add health checks
    * Set non-root user for security
  * [ ] Implement robust error handling (e.g., API errors, network issues).
    * Basic error handling implemented but needs improvement
  * [ ] Write comprehensive `README.md` documentation.
  * [ ] Add unit tests for database and utility functions.

#### **Current Issues**

1. **Docker Build Warnings**
   - Legacy ENV format warnings during build
   - Solution: Update Dockerfile to use `ENV key=value` format

2. **Typer Command Parameters**
   - Occasional `Parameter.make_metavar()` errors
   - Resolved by renaming reserved keywords and fixing decorators

3. **Configuration Loading**
   - Initial import issues between modules
   - Resolved by restructuring config loading
