# Planning and Phased Approach Guidelines

## When asked to plan or solve complex problems:

### 1. Always break down into phases
- Identify 3-5 distinct phases maximum
- Each phase should have clear deliverables
- Phases should build logically on each other
- Include estimated timeframes when relevant

### 2. Create actionable todo lists
- Use specific, measurable action items
- Start each item with an action verb
- Include who is responsible (if applicable)
- Add priority levels (High/Medium/Low)
- Include dependencies between tasks

### 3. Structure format
For each phase, provide:
- **Phase Name & Objective**
- **Key Deliverables**
- **Todo List** (with checkboxes)
- **Success Criteria**
- **Estimated Duration**
- **Dependencies/Prerequisites**

### 4. Planning principles to follow:
- Start with the end goal and work backwards
- Identify critical path items first
- Consider resource constraints and bottlenecks
- Build in buffer time for unexpected issues
- Include review/checkpoint moments
- Make tasks concrete and specific enough that someone else could execute them
